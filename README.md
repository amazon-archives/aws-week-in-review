The Week in Review is no longer being published. You can visit https://aws.amazon.com/new/ to track the latest product, service, and feature announcements from AWS.

The files in this GitHub Repo are used to produce the [AWS Week in Review](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/category/week-in-review/). 

Contributing is easy; you can simply create a GitHub account and make edits to the current `week-in-review/YYYY/MM/week-in-review-` file from the comfort of your web browser.  You can add your own content, or content from others. Read [this post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-week-in-review-coming-back-with-your-help/) for step-by-step directions.

**History**

In the early days of AWS, Jeff Barr wrote the Week in Review each week. Initially this took just 5 or 10 minutes, but as the pace of
innovation quickened and the size of the AWS community grew, Jeff sometimes spent 4 or 5 hours finding and formatting the content.

The new model, introduced in August of 2016, is crowdsourced. AWS fans, users, bloggers, and partners are all invited to contribute
to the project and to the AWS Week in Review.

**Content & Style Guidelines**

Here are the guidelines for making contributions:

* **Relevance** - All contributions must be directly related to AWS.
* **Ownership** - All contributions remain the property of the contributor, but you grant AWS an unlimited license.
* **Validity** - All links must be to publicly available content (links to free, gated content are fine).
* **Timeliness** - All contributions must refer to content that was created on the associated date.
* **Neutrality** - This is not the place for editorializing. Just the facts / links.

Here are the guidelines for style:

* Content from the [AWS Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/) is generally prefixed with "I wrote about POST_TITLE" or "We announced that TOPIC."
* Content from other AWS blogs is styled as "The BLOG_NAME wrote about POST_TITLE."
* Content from individuals is styled as "PERSON wrote about POST_TITLE."
* Content from partners and ISVs is styled as "The BLOG_NAME wrote about POST_TITLE."

There's room for some innovation and variation to keep things interesting, but keep it clean and concise.

**Weekly Schedule**

Here's the plan (all times are PT):

* Monday, 8:30 AM - HTML for previous week copied to WordPress and finalized.
* Monday, 10:00 AM - Week in Review published.
* Monday, 10:00 AM - HTML for current week created in GitHub.
* Monday to Monday - Current week edited by contributors and pull requests created.
* Monday to Monday - Pull requests accepted.

**Week in Review Sections**

Each Week in Review contains the following sections:

* Daily Summaries - content from the main AWS Blog, other AWS blogs, and everywhere else.
* New & Notable Open Source.
* New SlideShare Presentations.
* New YouTube Videos including APN Success Stories.
* New [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) products.

The OPML file ([`feeds.opml`](https://github.com/aws/aws-week-in-review/blob/master/feeds.opml)) in this repo contains a list of sources. Feel free to use it to find content, and add your own sources as well.
